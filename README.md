# kukkohelper

## General
This discord bot is created originally for Kylm√§t Kukot game groups server in order to implement key features for the community.

### Streamer features
#### Notification
Users that have role Role-Streamer will have bot announce when they start streaming.

#### Invite link
Streamer receives DM from kukkohelper which contains a invite link to server. This invite link only grants temporary access to channels stream-chat & stream-voice. Original idea was that low view count streamers who aren't often looking at their twitch chat could invite the viewers to participate in VoIP chat.
